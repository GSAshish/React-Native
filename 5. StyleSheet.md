>`STYLES IN RN IS NOT CSS THERE NAMES ARE INSPIRED FROM CSS BUT IT IS NOT CSS REGULAR JS OBJECT`

react does work for converting it to platform agnostic code component and then apply these style to it.

this means this style can be also a JavaScript object

you have two options for setting the style of the any RN component. You can either directly apply inline styles or use a style defined in your `styles` object.

1. Inline Style:
```jsx
<SafeAreaView style={{ backgroundColor: "red" }}>
  {/* Your content here */}
</SafeAreaView>
```

In this case, you're applying an inline style directly to the `SafeAreaView` component, setting the background color to red.

2. Using a Style Object:
```jsx
<SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
  {/* Your content here */}
</SafeAreaView>
```

In this case, you're using a style defined in your `styles` object. You would typically define your styles like this elsewhere in your code:

```jsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: "red",
    // other style properties
  },
});
```

The second approach using a style object is more commonly used in React Native applications because it allows you to centralize your styling in one place and reuse styles across multiple components. It also makes it easier to maintain and update your styles as your app grows.


what is need of `StyleSheet.create`?
1. it validate property we use here
2. RN is implementing optimizations' for this
3. add multiple style object
```jsx
<View style={[styles.container,styles.whiteContainer]}>
</View>
```


```jsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: "red",
    // other style properties
  },
  whiteContainer:{
   color:"white",
  }
});
```

where to keep your styles??
- depends on what you what usually people keep it in styles in same file as of component and some follow global styles.
-  i personally follow 
	- keeping main component related styles in component it self.
	- keeping core component + common and global style as common file.
