# what is react native

> a framework for building for building native apps using `javascript`

we don't need to know `ios` (swift and objective-c) and `Android` (java,kotlin) app (important: unless we don't need to build something complex)

# Ways to build react native apps
1. Expo cli
2. React Native CLI

if you never build any mobile app and new to it use expo and if you want  build something serious then use react native cli is go to move.

also setup of react native cli takes time refer this [docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native) (approx 1 hour it will take)

also you can always eject from expo to react native cli.
