>  **Dimensions of Component on screen**

there is something called Density-independent Pixels (DP)
`PhysicalPixel = DP * Scale_Factor`

```
Points 320 * 480
scaleFactor  2x
pixels 640 * 960
View Width with `150` will be 150 * 2 = 300

```

also you  can pass `50%` like value 

to get screen or window `Dimensions` api. 

- you can give window or screen as param to `.get` method 
- problem with this api is that it doesn't respond to orientation changes.
- To detect orientation change we do few steps.

```jsx
import {Dimensions} from "react-native";

export const App(){
	console.log(Dimensions.get("screen")); //width and height

	
	return (
	<View>
	  <Text>Hello Bro</Text>
	</View>
	)
}
```


`detect orientation change we do few steps`
- go to app.js orientation to default.
- there is one library called hooks .
	- install it by `npm i @react-native-community/hooks`
	- [docs](https://github.com/react-native-community/hooks)
`useDimensions` will always return correct value whether in any mode.
this is preferred way of using dimensions
```jsx
import {useDimensions,useDeviceOrientation} from "@react-native-community/hooks`";

export const App(){
	console.log(useDimensions()); // fontscale width and height
	// to get device orientation
	const isLanscape=useDeviceOrientation().lanscape;
	const isPortrait=useDeviceOrientation().portrait;

	return (
	<View>
	  <Text>Hello Bro</Text>
	</View>
	)
}
```


> **FlexBox**

- default direction is column here4
	- here primary axis is vertical axis (use JustifyContent)
	- and cross axis is horizontal axis (use Align items)
- there is no concept of grid here.
		can create it by adding number of rows to list.
		and flexbox.
 ```jsx
 <View style={{flex:1,backgroundColor:"red"}}>
	 <View style={{flex:2}}></View>// it  will take 50% height of parent 
	 <View style={{flex:1}}></View> // it will take 25%
	 <View style={{flex:1}}></View> // it will also take 25%
</View>
 // it's like dividing children in ratio to parent
 ```

In React Native, you can use Flexbox to control the layout of components within a parent container. Here are some key concepts and properties related to Flexbox in React Native:

1. **Container and Items**: In Flexbox, you have a container (parent) and items (children). The container is the parent component, and the items are the child components that you want to arrange.

2. **Flex Direction**: You can set the `flexDirection` property of the container to determine the main axis along which items will be laid out. It can be set to one of the following values:
   - `row`: Items are placed from left to right.
   - `row-reverse`: Items are placed from right to left.
   - `column`: Items are placed from top to bottom.
   - `column-reverse`: Items are placed from bottom to top.

3. **Justify Content**: The `justifyContent` property controls the alignment of items along the main axis. It determines how extra space is distributed. Common values include:
   - `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the start of the main axis.
   - `flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end of the main axis.
   - `center`: Items are centered along the main axis.
   - `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed with space between them.
   - `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with space around them.

4. **Align Items and Align Self**: The `alignItems` property controls the alignment of items along the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main axis). You can also use `alignSelf` to control the alignment of individual items.

5. **Flex Property**: You can assign a `flex` property to items. This property determines how items grow or shrink to fill available space relative to other items. It's usually a positive integer value, and items with higher `flex` values will take up more space.

6. **Flex Wrap**: By default, Flexbox items are placed in a single line. You can use the `flexWrap` property to allow items to wrap onto multiple lines if the container's space is not sufficient.

7. **Flex Grow and Shrink**: The `flexGrow` and `flexShrink` properties allow you to control how an item grows or shrinks within the available space when needed.

Here's an example of using Flexbox in React Native:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, flexDirection: 'column', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <View style={{ width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'red' }}>
        <Text>Item 1</Text>
      </View>
      <View style={{ width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'blue' }}>
        <Text>Item 2</Text>
      </View>
      <View style={{ width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'green' }}>
        <Text>Item 3</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we have a container with a column layout (`flexDirection: 'column'`), items that are centered both horizontally and vertically within the container, and each item has a fixed size and background color. You can adjust the Flexbox properties to achieve the layout you desire for your React Native application.

> Absolute and Relative positioning

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const PositioningExample = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {/* Relative Positioning */}
      <View style={styles.relativeContainer}>
        <Text style={styles.relativeText}>Relative 1</Text>
        <Text style={styles.relativeText}>Relative 2</Text>
      </View>

      {/* Absolute Positioning */}
      <View style={styles.absoluteContainer}>
        <Text style={styles.absoluteText}>Absolute 1</Text>
        <Text style={styles.absoluteText}>Absolute 2</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  relativeContainer: {
    backgroundColor: 'lightblue',
    padding: 10,
    position: 'relative', // Relative positioning
  },
  relativeText: {
    fontSize: 16,
    margin: 5,
  },
  absoluteContainer: {
    backgroundColor: 'lightcoral',
    padding: 10,
    position: 'absolute', // Absolute positioning
    top: 20,
    left: 20,
  },
  absoluteText: {
    fontSize: 16,
    margin: 5,
  },
});

export default PositioningExample;

```
