# View
	- fundamental Component for Building UI
	- View is like 
		- div in web app
		- UI View in ios
		- android.view in android

	- basically is a container
	- supports flexbox style some touch handling and some accesbility control (like talk back and voiceover ) 

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {View} from 'react-native';

const View=()=>{
	return (
		<View
			style={{
				flex:1,
				background:"red",
			}}
			/>
	)
}
 
```
screen with red color,
color is applied by `backgroundColor` and due to `flex:1` it is taking full screen basically it starts taking full space when you apply flex:1

> NOTE: -   Difference in mobile and web styling is everything in mobile is default `flex` property is not required to apply means donot need to give `display:flex` `flexDirection` default is column.


# SafeAreaView 

`SafeAreaView` is used to ensure that your app's content remains visible and properly positioned on screens with varying shapes and sizes. It takes care of padding or positioning your content to avoid overlapping with system UI elements like the status bar, navigation bar, and rounded corners.

**Example:**
Let's say you have a simple React Native app with a background color that you want to extend to the edges of the screen while keeping the content within the safe area. Here's how you could use `SafeAreaView`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.content}>
        {/* Your app's content */}
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1, // This ensures the SafeAreaView takes up the full screen height
    backgroundColor: 'blue', // Just an example background color
  },
  content: {
    flex: 1, // This allows the content to fill the available space within SafeAreaView
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

In this example, the `SafeAreaView` component is used to wrap the content of your app. The `container` style gives a background color to the entire screen while accommodating the safe area. The `content` style ensures that the content within `SafeAreaView` is centered vertically and horizontally.

# Text

`we can't put text anywhere as we do in web app
` we need to surround text with <Text>`
`you can also nested text`

```jsx
// BAD: will raise exception, can't have a text node as child of a <View>  
<View>  
Some random text 
</View>  
  
// GOOD  
<View>  
<Text>  
Some random text 
</Text>  
</View>

// nested text
 <Text style={styles.baseText}>
      parent text
      <Text style={styles.innerText}> children text</Text>
    </Text>
```

few import props that it takes
	- `numOfLines`: suppose if you will give `numOfLines={1}` then it will makes text force to be in one lines and will truncate all other text
	- `onPress` to perform any action when it is pressed
	- `ellipsizeMode`: When `numberOfLines` is set, this prop defines how the text will be truncated. `numberOfLines` must be set in conjunction with this prop.
	  `enum(`'head'`, `'middle'`, `'tail'`, `'clip'`)`
	  

# Images 

``Image` component allows you to render static images from your app's resources or load remote images from the web.`

```jsx
// for static image
<Image 
	source={require('./my-image.png')}
/>
// for non static image
<Image 
	source={{uri:"https://goole.png"}}
/>
```

`for non static image it is good to pass width and hight also`

```jsx
<Image 
	source={{width:200, 
	height:300,
	uri:"https://goole.png"}}
/>
```

for static we donot need to do it because it reads meta data of image and give height with by default

props
	- `blurRadius`: to make image blur takes number
	- `loadingIndicatorSource` this for showing loading image until source image is loading
	- `fadeDuration`: only support in android. for `ios` will have  to write custom style.
	- we also have `onLoad`,`onError`|`onProgress` etc.

>in web you can directly `background-image` property to make some background fill with image to do similar thing
you can use `ImageBackground` component
## ImageBackground
props
- `source`: which is similar to image component
- `resizeMode`: `contain`| `stretch`| `repeat` | `center`


# Touchables

`image component doesnot have onPress event so suppose we have to trigger press event then we use touchables`

1. `TouchableHighlight`
2. `TouchableOpacity`
3. `TouchableWithoutFeedback`

```jsx
 // On press down, through, darkening or tinting the view.
<TouchableHighlight  
activeOpacity={0.6}  
underlayColor="#DDDDDD"  
onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>  
<MyComponent />  
</TouchableHighlight>;


// . On press down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, dimming it.
<TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={onPress}>
        <Text>Press Here</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>

//supports only one child
// IMPORTANT: Do not use unless you have a very good reason because
// All elements that respond to press should have a visual feedback when touched.
<TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>  
<MyComponent />  
</TouchableWithoutFeedback>;
```

>There is also `TouchableNativeFeedback` which is not supported on ios so you can use `TouchableNativeFeedback` on android by writing more platform specific code (by using `Platform.os==="andriod"`) and on `ios` you can use `TouchableOpacity`


>also touchable native feedback cannot be passed image it should get View or something which take onPress event


# Button

```jsx
<Button  
onPress={onPressLearnMore}  
title="Learn More"  
color="#841584"  
accessibilityLabel="Learn more about this purple button"  
/>
```

buttons looks different based on platform so that's why we can create our own component for button.
```jsx
export default function MyButton({buttonStyles,onPress,disabled,label})=>{
return(
 <TouchableOpacity onPress={}>
        <View style={buttonStyles}>
          <Text style={textStyles} disabled={disabled}>
            {label}
          </Text>
        </View>
</TouchableOpacity>
)
}

```



# Alert

is mapped to it's native alert

```jsx
<Button onPress={()=>Alert.alert("My title",
								 "My message",[{text:"Yes",
								 onPress:()=>{
								 console.log("Yes")}},
								 {text:"No",
								 onPress:()=>{
								 console.log("No")}}])} 
								/>
```

In React Native, `Alert` and `Alert.prompt` are methods provided by the `Alert` module for displaying simple alert messages and prompts to the user. These methods allow you to show native-like pop-up dialogs to communicate important information or gather input from the user.

Here's an overview of how to use both `Alert` and `Alert.prompt`:

1. **Alert:**
   The `Alert` module provides a method called `alert` that displays a simple alert message with an "OK" button. This is useful for showing information or notifications to the user.

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { View, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';

   const App = () => {
     const showAlert = () => {
       Alert.alert(
         'Alert Title',
         'This is an example alert message.',
         [{ text: 'OK', onPress: () => console.log('OK Pressed') }]
       );
     };

     return (
       <View>
         <Button title="Show Alert" onPress={showAlert} />
       </View>
     );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

2. **Alert.prompt:**
   The `Alert` module also provides a method called `prompt` that displays a prompt dialog with an input field. This is useful for collecting user input.

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { View, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';

   const App = () => {
     const showPrompt = () => {
       Alert.prompt(
         'Enter a Value',
         'Please enter a value:',
         (value) => console.log('You entered:', value),
         undefined,
         'default'
       );
     };

     return (
       <View>
         <Button title="Show Prompt" onPress={showPrompt} />
       </View>
     );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

   In the example above, the `showPrompt` function uses `Alert.prompt` to display a dialog with an input field where the user can enter a value. The third parameter of the `Alert.prompt` method is a callback function that gets triggered when the user submits the input.

Both `Alert` and `Alert.prompt` are part of the React Native core modules, and they provide a simple way to interact with users in a familiar and intuitive way. Remember that user experience should always be a priority, and these methods offer a convenient way to communicate with users effectively.
