React Native provides a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow you to interact with the underlying native components and functionality of mobile devices.

1. **UI Components:**
2. **Platform-Specific Code:**
3. **Styling:**
4. **Navigation:**
5. **Networking:**
6. **Async Storage:** API allows you to store and retrieve data asynchronously on the device. It's often used to save user preferences, cached data, and other small pieces of information.
7. **Device Features:**
   - **Camera and Photo**
   - **Geolocation:** 
   - **Clipboard:**
   - **Push Notifications:** APIs like `PushNotificationIOS` and third-party libraries like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) enable push notifications.
   - **Permissions:** The `PermissionsAndroid` and `PermissionsIOS` modules help you request and manage permissions required for various device features.
   
8. **Animations:**
9. **Third-Party Libraries:** (e.g., Redux, react-native-vector-icons).
