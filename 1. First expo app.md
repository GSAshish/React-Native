Inside app.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {StyleSheet,Text,View} from 'react-native';

export default function App(){
	return (
	<View Style={styles.container}>
		<Text> Hello my react native app</Text>
	</View>
	);
}
const styles=StyleSheet.create({
	container:{
		flex:1,
		justifyContent:"center",
		alignItems:"center",
	}
})
```


Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Import Statements:**
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
   ```
   These lines import necessary modules from the `react` and `react-native` packages.

2. **Functional Component:**
   ```javascript
   export default function App() {
   ```
   This is a functional component named `App`. It's the main entry point of your React Native application.

3. **JSX Markup:**
   ```javascript
   return (
     <View style={styles.container}>
       <Text> Hello my react native app</Text>
     </View>
   );
   ```
   This is the JSX markup that will be rendered by the component. It consists of a `View` component (similar to a `div` in web development) that wraps around a `Text` component, displaying the text "Hello my react native app."

4. **Styles:**
   ```javascript
   const styles = StyleSheet.create({
     container: {
       flex: 1,
       justifyContent: "center",
       alignItems: "center",
     },
   });
   ```
   The `styles` object is defined using the `StyleSheet.create` method. It contains a single style definition named `container` that uses flexbox properties to center its content both vertically (`justifyContent`) and horizontally (`alignItems`) within the available space.

Remember that in React Native, the styling works a bit differently from web development. React Native uses a subset of CSS, and styles are typically applied directly to components using JavaScript objects.

To run this code, make sure you have a React Native development environment set up, including Node.js, `npm` or `yarn`, and the necessary emulators or devices. You can create a new React Native project, replace the default content with the code you provided, and run the project to see the text centered on the screen in your mobile app.
